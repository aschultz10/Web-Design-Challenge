# Web-Design-Challenge

> In this assignment, I used HTML to create a website based on data provided by the university. I used a CSS file to style the website. 


> This homework was particularly tough and took a very long time to complete (15-20 hours). The style.css file was hard to correct and I could not figure out the padding in the  container class. Overall, I enjoyed the assignment and I like HTML, but maybe with some more experience the smaller nuances would come easier to me. 


> I liked learning CSS and think it's a great styling tool. It makes a lot of logical sense. An amazing tool is w3schools.com, as mentioned many times by our instructors. This website helped correct many of my syntax errors that would have taken a while to find in the classwork we did last week while also introducing me to many new pieces of code I was unfamiliar with. Connecting the HTML files with the CSS wasn't difficult, more so what information would actually be displayed on the HTML link I wanted. And it was easy to see your progress due to the live browser that constantly updated the website I created. 


> The more time I would spend with HTML, the better the coding came to me. I look forward to using HTML more in order to get it down to a science.
